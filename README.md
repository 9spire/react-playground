# Purpose

In order to be a better developer, it's practice that makes perfect. By creating this small, simple site without a tutorial, armed with search engines and a day-to-day experience, I seek to be better at my job, and have a richer understanding.

## What I used

Using Create React App, a router, fetching from free APIs, and heavily borrowing from the default Material UI, I am learning to build from the blank .js page.

## What I would do differently

It's not done yet so there's a list of todos still.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
